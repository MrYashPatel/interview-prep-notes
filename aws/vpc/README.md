## **1 — Beginner Level: The Absolute Basics**

### **What is a VPC?**

* **VPC** = Your **own private, isolated network** inside AWS.
* You choose the **IP range** (CIDR block), subnets, routing, and security.
* VPC = A virtual version of an on-premises network.

### **Key VPC Building Blocks**

| Component                         | Purpose                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CIDR Block**                    | The range of IP addresses for your VPC (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).                |
| **Subnets**                       | Divides the VPC into smaller ranges — can be public or private.              |
| **Route Tables**                  | Define where traffic from subnets should go.                                 |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)**        | Lets public subnets reach the internet.                                      |
| **NAT Gateway**                   | Lets private subnets access the internet *without* being exposed to it.      |
| **Security Groups**               | Instance-level firewalls (stateful).                                         |
| **Network ACLs**                  | Subnet-level firewalls (stateless).                                          |
| **VPC Peering / Transit Gateway** | Connects VPCs together.                                                      |
| **VPC Endpoints**                 | Private connectivity to AWS services without going over the public internet. |

### **Interview Tip**

> "A VPC is like a virtual office building: the CIDR block is the building’s total space, subnets are the rooms, route tables are the floor maps, security groups are the locked doors, and the Internet Gateway is the main entrance."

## **2 — Intermediate Level: DevOps Daily Usage**

### **Public vs Private Subnet**

* **Public Subnet**: Routes 0.0.0.0/0 traffic to IGW.
* **Private Subnet**: Routes 0.0.0.0/0 traffic to NAT Gateway (or no internet at all).

---

### **Common DevOps Patterns**

1. **Public ALB → Private EC2/EKS**

   * ALB in public subnet → forwards to private instances.
2. **Bastion Host for SSH**

   * Bastion in public subnet → allows SSH to private instances.
3. **VPC Endpoints**

   * For S3/DynamoDB so traffic never leaves AWS backbone.
4. **Multi-AZ Subnet Design**

   * Always create at least **2 public** and **2 private subnets** across AZs for HA.

### **CIDR Planning for Fintech**

Example for `/16`:

```
10.0.0.0/16 → Entire VPC
10.0.0.0/20 → Public Subnet AZ1
10.0.16.0/20 → Public Subnet AZ2
10.0.32.0/20 → Private Subnet AZ1
10.0.48.0/20 → Private Subnet AZ2
```

## **3 — Advanced Level: Architecture & Security**

### **Multi-Account Networking**

* **AWS Organizations + Transit Gateway** → Centralized hub for VPC connectivity.
* **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** → Restrict VPC creation or IGW usage in certain accounts.

---

### **Security Best Practices**

* Default NACLs are open — tighten them.
* Disable `0.0.0.0/0` SSH access — use bastion or SSM Session Manager.
* Use **Flow Logs** for auditing — send to S3/CloudWatch.
* Use **VPC Endpoints** to avoid public exposure to AWS services.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

* **MTU** for EC2 → Jumbo frames (9001) for high-performance workloads.
* **Cross-region traffic** → Use AWS Global Accelerator, not just peering.
* Avoid overlapping CIDR in multi-VPC setups — peering won’t work with overlaps.

## **4 — Top 1%: Expert-Level FAQs & Real-world Scenarios**

### **FAQ #1 — How do you connect two VPCs in different regions?**

* **Option 1**: VPC Peering (simple, no transitive routing).
* **Option 2**: Transit Gateway (better for multi-VPC hubs).
* **Option 3**: VPN over the internet or AWS Direct Connect for on-prem hybrid.

---

### **FAQ #2 — Can I have overlapping CIDR blocks between VPCs?**

* Yes, but:

  * Peering won’t work.
  * Transit Gateway won’t allow overlapping.
  * You’ll need NAT or proxy translation.

### **FAQ #3 — Difference between SG and NACL?**

| Feature   | Security Group                       | NACL                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Level     | Instance/ENI                         | Subnet                       |
| Stateful? | Yes                                  | No                           |
| Rules     | Allow only                           | Allow & Deny                 |
| Default   | Deny all inbound, allow all outbound | Allow all inbound & outbound |

### **FAQ #4 — How to make private subnet access AWS services without internet?**

* Use **VPC Endpoint**:

  * **Gateway endpoint** for S3 & DynamoDB.
  * **Interface endpoint** for other services.

---

### **FAQ #5 — How to make a VPC highly available across AZs?**

* Minimum: 2 public + 2 private subnets in **different AZs**.
* Place redundant NAT Gateways (one per AZ) for private subnet internet access.

---

### **FAQ #6 — How to troubleshoot “Instance can’t reach the internet”?**

1. Check route table (0.0.0.0/0 to IGW for public, to NAT for private).
2. Check subnet is mapped to correct route table.
3. Check Security Group outbound rules.
4. Check NACL outbound rules.
5. Verify IGW attached to VPC.

---

### **FAQ #7 — How to secure inter-service traffic inside a VPC?**

* Use **SG referencing**: Allow traffic from another SG instead of IP ranges.
* Apply **NACL restrictions** for subnet isolation.
* For EKS, use **CNI security groups per pod**.

---

### **Real-World Expert Scenarios**

* **Scenario**: You have 50+ microservices in EKS and want them to talk internally without public exposure.
  **Solution**: Use private subnets for worker nodes + NLB internal mode + VPC Endpoints for S3/DynamoDB.

* **Scenario**: DR across regions for fintech database.
  **Solution**: Replicate DB to another region’s VPC, connect via inter-region Transit Gateway, and pre-provision route tables.

* **Scenario**: Blue/Green environment isolation.
  **Solution**: Separate VPCs for Blue and Green, connected via Transit Gateway only for shared services (DB, logging).
