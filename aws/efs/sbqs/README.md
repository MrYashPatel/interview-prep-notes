## 1. **EFS vs EBS vs S3 ‚Üí When to use?**

**EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

* Block storage attached to a single EC2 instance (like a virtual hard disk).
* Use case: Databases, boot volumes, transactional workloads needing low latency.
* Limitation: Tied to one AZ (though you can snapshot/restore elsewhere).

**EFS (Elastic File System)**

* Managed NFS (POSIX-compliant file system), shared across multiple EC2, EKS pods, or Lambda.
* Use case: Shared storage for applications, CMS, microservices needing concurrent read/write.
* Scales automatically, pay-per-use.

**S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

* Object storage (not block or file).
* Highly durable (11 9‚Äôs), globally accessible.
* Use case: Backups, static website hosting, big data, logs, images, artifacts.
* Not for low-latency transactional workloads.

üëâ **Rule of Thumb:**

* **EBS** ‚Üí single instance, high-performance workloads.
* **EFS** ‚Üí multiple instances/pods need shared file access.
* **S3** ‚Üí large-scale, unstructured object storage.

## 2. **Can EFS be used for Windows?**

* **No** ‚ùå ‚Üí EFS is **POSIX-compliant (Linux-only)**.
* Windows uses **Amazon FSx for Windows File Server** (SMB protocol).
  üëâ Interview Tip: "EFS = Linux (NFS), FSx = Windows (SMB)."

## 3. **Default Throughput vs Provisioned Throughput (EFS)**

* **Default (Elastic Throughput / Bursting Mode)**

  * Throughput scales with the amount of data stored.
  * Example: 1 TB stored ‚Üí baseline \~50 MB/s throughput, bursts up to 100 MB/s.
  * Good for normal workloads where throughput needs grow with storage.

* **Provisioned Throughput**

  * You set throughput manually, independent of storage size.
  * Example: Even if you store only 100 GB, you can provision 1 GB/s throughput.
  * Useful for small datasets with high performance needs (e.g., analytics, build pipelines).

## 4. **What does Lifecycle Policy do?**

* **EFS Lifecycle Management Policy** ‚Üí Moves **infrequently accessed files** to **EFS Infrequent Access (IA) storage class** automatically after N days (7, 14, 30, 60, 90).
* Saves cost (EFS-IA is \~92% cheaper).
* When file is accessed again ‚Üí auto-moves back to standard.

üëâ Interview Phrase: ‚ÄúEFS lifecycle policy = automatic tiering to reduce storage cost.‚Äù

## 5. **What is required to mount EFS?**

To mount an EFS file system on EC2/EKS pods, you need:

1. **Security Group**

   * Allow inbound **NFS (TCP/2049)** on the EFS mount target SG.
   * Ensure EC2 instance SG allows outbound to EFS SG.

2. **NFS Client**

   * Install NFS client (`nfs-utils` or `amazon-efs-utils`) on EC2 / container.
   * Example mount command:

     ```bash
     sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1 fs-12345678.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /mnt/efs
     ```

3. **IAM Role (Optional)**

   * If using **EFS Access Points + IAM authorization**, you need IAM policies.
   * Example: Allow `elasticfilesystem:ClientMount`, `ClientWrite`.

‚úÖ **Interview-Ready Short Answer**:

* **EBS vs EFS vs S3** ‚Üí Block vs File vs Object storage, different workloads.
* **EFS for Windows?** ‚Üí No, use FSx.
* **Throughput** ‚Üí Default scales with size, Provisioned is manual override.
* **Lifecycle policy** ‚Üí Move files to IA to cut cost.
* **Mounting needs** ‚Üí SG (2049 open), NFS client, optional IAM for access points.
