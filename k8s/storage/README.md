# ðŸš€ Level 1: Beginner (Basics of Storage in K8s)

### ðŸ”¹ Concepts

* Pods are **ephemeral** â†’ data lost when Pod dies.
* **Volume** = attach storage to a Pod.
* **Persistent Volume (PV)** = cluster resource for storage.
* **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** = Podâ€™s request for storage.
* **StorageClass (SC)** = defines type of storage (SSD/HDD, encrypted, etc.), enables dynamic provisioning.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Beginner Scenario

ðŸ‘‰ *You deploy a MySQL Pod. After deleting the Pod, your database data is lost. What will you do?*
âœ… Answer: Use **PVC with a StorageClass** so data is persisted on disk even if Pod is deleted.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Beginner Interview Questions

1. Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between `emptyDir` and `hostPath` volume?
   A: `emptyDir` â†’ temporary storage inside Podâ€™s lifecycle. `hostPath` â†’ maps Node filesystem (not portable).

2. Q: What is PVC?
   A: A **claim** that requests storage from PV.

# ðŸš€ Level 2: Intermediate (Persistent Storage)

### ðŸ”¹ Concepts

* **Access Modes**:

  * RWO (ReadWriteOnce) â†’ single Node write (EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk).
  * RWX (ReadWriteMany) â†’ multiple Nodes write (EFS, NFS, CephFS).
* **Reclaim Policies**: Retain, Delete.
* **Binding**: PVC must match PV capacity + access modes.
* **Dynamic Provisioning** via StorageClass.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Scenario

ðŸ‘‰ *Your app runs on 3 replicas (Pods) in different Nodes. All replicas must write to the same shared storage. What do you use?*
âœ… Answer: Use **RWX storage** like **EFS, NFS, or CephFS**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Interview Questions

1. Q: If PVC requests 10Gi but only a 5Gi PV exists, will it bind?
   A: No, PVC requires equal or larger storage.

2. Q: What happens if a PVC is deleted but PV reclaimPolicy = Retain?
   A: PVC is deleted, but PV + actual data remains (admin must clean manually).

# ðŸš€ Level 3: Advanced (Stateful Apps & CSI)

### ðŸ”¹ Concepts

* **StatefulSets + Headless Service + PVC** â†’ for DBs.
* **StorageClass Parameters** (SSD, IOPS, encryption).
* **Volume Expansion** (PVC resize).
* **CSI Drivers** â†’ modern storage interface for Kubernetes (cloud or on-prem).
* **Snapshots & Cloning** for backup/restore.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Scenario

ðŸ‘‰ *You are running PostgreSQL in Kubernetes using StatefulSet. You need daily snapshots for backup and the ability to restore to a previous point in time. How do you achieve this?*
âœ… Answer: Use **CSI VolumeSnapshots** with snapshot-controller for automated backups.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Interview Questions

1. Q: Why is `hostPath` bad for production?
   A: Ties data to a single Node â†’ not portable, unsafe if Node crashes.

2. Q: What is the benefit of CSI over in-tree storage plugins?
   A: CSI is **standardized + externalized** â†’ allows 3rd-party storage vendors (Ceph, Portworx, Longhorn, AWS EBS) to integrate without touching K8s core code.

3. Q: How to expand a PVC from 5Gi to 10Gi?
   A: Update PVC spec â†’ StorageClass must allow volume expansion.

# ðŸš€ Level 4: Expert (Top 1%)

### ðŸ”¹ Concepts

* **Multi-zone & Multi-cluster storage** strategies.
* **Performance tuning**: latency, IOPS, throughput.
* **Backup & Disaster Recovery**: Velero, CSI snapshots, replication.
* **Hybrid storage**: mix of cloud & on-prem CSI drivers.
* **Security**: encrypt storage at rest, restrict PVCs via RBAC.
* **Storage troubleshooting**: pending PVCs, stuck PVs, RWX deadlocks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Expert Scenario

ðŸ‘‰ *You run MongoDB cluster in K8s across 3 AZs in AWS. A Node in AZ-1 crashes and PV in EBS is stuck. Your app goes down. How do you redesign?*
âœ… Answer:

* Use **EFS (RWX, multi-AZ)** or **Portworx/Longhorn (replicated block storage)** instead of EBS.
* Enable **anti-affinity** so replicas donâ€™t land in same AZ.
* Use **snapshot + restore automation** for recovery.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Expert Interview Questions

1. Q: What happens if two Pods across Nodes try to mount the same RWO PVC?
   A: Only one Pod will succeed, other will be pending.

2. Q: How do you handle disaster recovery in Kubernetes storage?
   A: Use **Velero** for backup/restore of PVs, or CSI snapshots. Replicate storage across zones (EFS, Ceph, Portworx).

3. Q: How would you design storage for a multi-tenant SaaS platform where each customer has its own DB in Kubernetes?
   A:

   * Use **dynamic provisioning** via StorageClass.
   * Isolate storage per namespace (resource quotas).
   * Use **RWX storage** for shared apps, RWO for dedicated DBs.
   * Implement **encryption per tenant** (KMS).
