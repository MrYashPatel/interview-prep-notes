## 🚨 1. *State Management Issues*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Team accidentally overwrites remote state (terraform apply without pulling latest state).
* State file corruption or manual modification.
* Orphaned resources due to drift.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use *remote backend* (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking).
* Always run terraform plan before apply.
* Use terraform state list, show, mv, and rm to inspect and fix broken state.
* Enable *state locking* with DynamoDB for AWS.

---

## 🧩 2. *Dependency Hell Between Modules*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Circular or tangled dependencies between modules.
* Implicit dependency chains not clear.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use *explicit depends_on* to break ambiguity.
* Refactor monolith modules into *reusable, composable modules*.
* Use terraform graph to visualize dependencies.

---

## ⛓️ 3. *Provider Version Inconsistencies*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Different environments have different provider versions.
* CI/CD behaves differently from local.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Lock provider versions in .terraform.lock.hcl.
* Commit .terraform.lock.hcl to Git.
* Use terraform init -upgrade carefully and review changes.
* Pin versions using required_providers block.

---

## 🔁 4. *DRY Principle Violation – Code Duplication*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Same resources repeated across modules/environments.
* Hard to maintain.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use *modules* to abstract reusable components.
* Pass environment-specific values via terraform.tfvars.
* Use locals and count/for_each for resource repetition.

---

## ⚠️ 5. *Terraform Plan Drift / Manual Changes in AWS*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Someone changes infra manually via AWS Console → terraform plan shows drift.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Enforce *infra-as-code only policy*.
* Run *scheduled terraform plan* in CI to detect drift.
* Use tools like *Infracost, **driftctl, or **tfsec*.

---

## 🔐 6. *Secret Management*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Secrets hardcoded in *.tf files or passed via variables insecurely.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use *AWS Secrets Manager, **Vault, or **environment variables*.
* Use sensitive = true in variables.
* Do not log or output secrets.

---

## 💣 7. *Race Conditions in CI/CD*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Multiple PRs apply Terraform at the same time → state lock error.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use *state locking with S3+DynamoDB*.
* Introduce terraform plan → manual approval → apply.
* Use *workflow dispatch* or GitHub environments for approvals.

---

## 🧪 8. *Testing Infrastructure Code*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Hard to test Terraform changes without applying.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use *terraform plan + approval* model.
* Use *terraform validate*, terraform fmt, checkov, tflint, tfsec.
* Use *Terratest* or *kitchen-terraform* for deeper testing.

---

## 🔄 9. *Upgrading Terraform or Providers*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Breaking changes in new Terraform versions or provider versions.
* Legacy config becomes incompatible.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use terraform 0.14upgrade, 0.15upgrade, etc. carefully.
* Read *changelogs* before upgrading providers.
* Use *version constraints* wisely (~>, >=, <=).

---

## 🌐 10. *Multi-Environment Management*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Multiple copies of the same infra for dev, staging, prod.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use *workspaces* (with caution) or better:

  * Create per-env folders/modules.
  * Use Terraform Cloud or backend workspaces per env.
* Manage secrets, vars, and state per environment.

---

## 🚧 11. *Resource Recreation (destroy-create) Unexpectedly*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Minor change causes full destroy-create → downtime.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Check *terraform plan* carefully.
* Use lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true } where needed.
* Use *create_before_destroy* or *ignore_changes* in lifecycle block.

---

## 🔍 12. *Resource Drift or Configuration Discrepancy*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Values in AWS don't match .tf file but plan doesn't catch it.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use terraform refresh or terraform state show for inspection.
* Reconcile differences using terraform import if needed.

---

## 🔐 13. *IAM and Terraform Permissions*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Terraform apply fails due to missing IAM perms.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Create a *least privilege IAM policy* for Terraform.
* Use separate IAM roles per module (assume role pattern).
* Validate with terraform apply dry runs in CI.

---

## 🔥 14. *Destroy Risk or Accidental terraform destroy*

### 🔹 Problem:

* Engineer accidentally destroys production.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use prevent_destroy lifecycle.
* Protect CI/CD with approvals.
* Use terraform plan -out=tfplan and apply tfplan to prevent surprises.

-----------------------------------------------------------



## 🧠 1. *Terraform Architecture Design – Org-Level*

### 🧨 Problem:

* Multiple teams, environments, accounts → need centralized control.
* Inconsistent tagging, policies, naming conventions.
* Need for shared service modules (VPC, logging, KMS, etc).

### 🧠 Resolution (You should drive this):

* Create a *Terraform mono-repo or split-repo strategy*.
* Use *Terraform Cloud/Enterprise* or *Terragrunt* for org-level management.
* Enforce standards using pre-commit, tflint, tfsec, and custom policies.
* Define *standardized modules* for networking, IAM, tagging, logging.

---

## 🔐 2. *Fintech-Level Compliance + Secrets Handling*

### 🧨 Problem:

* Cannot leak or hardcode secrets or use plaintext outputs.
* Must comply with SOC 2, ISO 27001, or PCI DSS.

### 🔐 Resolution:

* Integrate with *AWS Secrets Manager* or *Vault* using data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" blocks.
* Use sensitive = true, suppress output of secrets.
* Encrypt state at rest (S3 + KMS) and use secure backends.
* Integrate with OIDC/IRSA or service accounts (in EKS/Terraform Cloud).

---

## 📦 3. *Immutable Infrastructure with Zero Downtime*

### 🧨 Problem:

* Resource change leads to downtime (e.g., ALB, RDS, ECS, EKS nodegroups recreation).

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use create_before_destroy, ignore_changes, and blue-green deployment patterns.
* For ALBs/Target Groups, ensure Terraform references avoid full replacement.
* For EKS worker groups: *self-managed blue/green nodegroups*, then taint, then drain.
* For RDS: use skip_final_snapshot, but with *manual backup enforcement*.

---

## ⛓️ 4. *Complex Multi-Account Deployment*

### 🧨 Problem:

* Terraform across 5–10 AWS accounts.
* Need cross-account IAM assume-role, secret access, S3 state sharing.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use *IAM role chaining* with profile switching or federated access via OIDC.
* Set up *Terraform backends per account/environment* with secure isolation.
* Use *Terragrunt or environment-layered architecture*.
* Use provider "aws" { alias = "xyz" } and assume_role.

---

## 📜 5. *Terraform Governance – Code Review and Policy Enforcement*

### 🧨 Problem:

* Developers write insecure or expensive Terraform.
* Lack of control over provisioning.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Integrate checkov, tflint, terraform validate, infracost in CI.
* Use *OPA (Open Policy Agent)* with Sentinel/TFLint rules.
* Create GitHub PR templates for infra changes.
* Review terraform plan artifacts via pipeline.

---

## 📊 6. *Cost Visibility and Forecasting*

### 🧨 Problem:

* Terraform creates high-cost resources, bills spike.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use [Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/) to calculate changes.
* Create Slack alerts for monthly deltas.
* Enforce tagging via locals and variables.

---

## 💥 7. *Recovering from Broken States or Failures*

### 🧨 Problem:

* Someone broke production infra or deleted resources from AWS Console.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Enable full state backups (versioned S3).
* Use terraform state CLI: mv, rm, import, and replace-provider.
* Use terraform import and re-align state with existing AWS infra.

---

## 🌐 8. *DR and Multi-Region Infra*

### 🧨 Problem:

* High-availability infra needs to be provisioned in multiple regions.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use modules with var.region and provider aliasing.
* Create region-aware backends.
* Use conditionals for region-specific resources.

---

## 🔁 9. *CI/CD for Terraform – Safe and Auditable*

### 🧨 Problem:

* Uncontrolled terraform apply from dev machines.
* No approvals or audit trails.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Setup CI/CD with:

  * terraform fmt, validate, plan, infracost, tfsec
  * Manual plan approval
  * apply only with approvals (GitHub Environments or GitHub App Approvers).
* Use plan artifact to match apply.

---

## ⚔️ 10. *Terraform with GitOps*

### 🧨 Problem:

* GitHub → apply to multiple environments with visibility and control.

### ✅ Resolution:

* Use tools like Atlantis, Spacelift, Terraform Cloud, or custom GitHub Actions.
* For GitHub Actions:

  * Workflow for terraform plan, store plan as artifact.
  * On manual approval: download and terraform apply that plan.
  * Enforce reviewers via branch protections.
